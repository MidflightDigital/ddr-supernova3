!lines that start with ! are comments and are treated as if they didn't exist at all
!One blank (so comments don't count) line starts a new section. The first line in the section is treated as the header.
!A sequence of blank lines is treated identically to one blank line.
!If there is an equals sign at any point in a line except the beginning, whatever is after it becomes a name variable equal to what comes before it.
!If a line starts with an equals sign, it is replaced with the contents of the name variable. It is an error to use a name variable that hasn't been defined.
!Overwriting name variables is an error.
!The predefined name variable "BLANK" can be used to insert a blank line in the middle of a section.
!Name variables are case sensitive.
