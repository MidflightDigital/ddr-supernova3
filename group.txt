group.ini support in DDR SuperNOVA 3
------------------------------------

To allow for greater flexibility when structuring songs, DDR SuperNOVA 3 r7 and later have partial support for A.C.'s group.ini format.

It is defined here: http://sm.waiei.net/other/group.html (Japanese)
This file is principally based on a Google "translation" of that page, augmented and corrected by checking:
*the EXFolder Development Kit (http://sm.waiei.net/other/kit_exfolder.html)
*waiei2 20170523A (http://sm.waiei.net/waiei2/)
*the group.ini file included with FIXED Project 5 Append

File format
-----------
A file called "group.ini" is placed in each group folder where you want to use its functionality.
Despite the ini extension, the group.ini format is really an MSD-like format.
The recommended encoding is UTF-8.

Comments are supported by placing // at the beginning of the line *only*.
No whitespace or anything else may precede it. 

The general layout of a tag is:

#tagname:content:content:...;

Tag names are case-insensitive. Content areas may or may not be.
There may be whitespace between or within content areas. Whitespace within content areas is significant, but between them it is not.
Any characters that come before the #tagname will be ignored unless they would cause the line to be a comment.

A commonly used content element is what I'll call a "list" for lack of a better term:

subcontent|subcontent|...

Whitespace is not significant between them.

Note: when a song name is specified, it's actually specified by its directory name.

Supported tags
--------------
#NAME:display_name;
Sets the displayed name of the group to display_name.

#MENUCOLOR:r,g,b,a:r,g,b,a|song_a|song_b|...:...;
Controls the text color of song names.
If no songs are specified, this sets the text color for every song in the group.
If any number of songs are specified, this sets the text color just for those songs. This overrides any non-specific text color.

#METERTYPE:DDR/ITG/DDR X:(the three)|song_a|...:...;
This sets which rating scale is used for a group or a song within it.
DDR corresponds to the classic 1-10 DDR scale. Its "hard threshold" is 11.
ITG corresponds to the extended ITG scale. Its "hard threshold" is 13.
DDR X corresponds to the current 1-20 DDR scale. Its "hard threshold" is 17.

SuperNOVA 3 mainly uses this to decide which difficulty list mode to use.
If this is not set, it uses the default. If it's set to DDR, it uses the classic difficulty list mode.
If it's set to ITG or DDR X, it uses the X difficulty list mode.

Unsupported standard* tags
--------------------------
(Some or all of these tags will eventually be supported.)
#EXTRA*:;
This is a large family of tags that control various Extra Stage related things.
I haven't documented them yet.

#COMMENT:free_text;
This sets free_text as a comment for the group. If it contains a list, each element of the list will be placed on its own line.

#URL:text;
Sets text as a URL for the group. 

#SORTLIST_FRONT:song_a:song_b:...;
#SORTLIST_REAR:song_a:song_b:...;
These put their arguments, in order, as the first or last songs of a group.
If a song is in both tags, FRONT takes priority.

#EXTRAATEND:0/1;
If 1, EXTRA songs are sorted at the end of the group.
This includes all songs listed:
#EXTRA1LIST, #EXTRA2LIST, extra1.crs, extra2.crs

#LYRICTYPE:Old;
If this statement is present, lyric animations will act like they did in 3.9.
If it is anything other than Old (likely not case sensitive) it will have no effect.

*"standard" here means tags that A.C. documents at that page. No theme supports every group.ini tag. All themes ignore any tags they do not support.

Other tags in the wild
----------------------
#USEEXTRACOLOR:0/1;
Apparently XXmiX specific, and I can't download the XXmiX theme right now to check what it does.
Probably controls whether the automatically chosen Extra Stage song gets the extra color.

#BRANCHLIST:name|arrow>tag>lists|...;
Apparently only supported by CyberiaStyle.
Sets up a branching song set up in the style of DDR's EVOLVED songs.
name is the name of the song to replace in the wheel.
The arrow tag lines are:

  Random>song>song...
  A list of all of the possible random choices.

  Jacket>path
  Banner>path
  The relative path to the banner and jacket graphics from the group.ini file.

  Title>text
  Artist>text
  Self-explanatory.

#GROUPCOLOR:r,g,b,a;
Only supported by DDR SuperNOVA 3.
Sets the color of the group on the wheel to the given color.
